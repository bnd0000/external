To provide an additional layer of security and flexibility, **we will introduce two versions of XbaNd79aGo09B**:

**Strictly External Version (Backup):** This version will serve as a reliable backup option. In case any unforeseen circumstances, such as byfron patches affecting our internal methods, arise, this version will be there to ensure uninterrupted access to the essential features.
